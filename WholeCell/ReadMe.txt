Whole_Cell_Wild_Type.ipynb:

This directory contains the notebook required to run the code I created to analyze the path manifold for the PdU system

The actual "data" files which contain the time series for 51x51 parameter sets is too  large to attach here. I am including the link to my box folder that contains the data files

https://northwestern.box.com/s/rp8ggeo0j9h9a76fmsvrtfox7na4ufls

These files should be placed in a directory called "WildType" which is below the main directory in which the jupyter notebook is run.


WholeCellPCA.py:

Also contains python file for a 4D parameter sweep. "Data" is again too large to fit here. Data can be generated by sweeping over the desired parameters and saving files as 1. Substrate.txt, Intermediate.txt, Product.txt, Times.txt, Parameters.txt
Each row of data file corresponds to time series of one parameter set. These are inputs for the WholeCellPCA.py file.
